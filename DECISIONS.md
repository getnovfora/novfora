# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Decision log for **Hearth** (working codename). Each ADR is the short, durable record; the linked Stage A doc
holds the full rationale, tradeoffs, and detail. New significant decisions are added here via the RFC/ADR
process in [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md). Status values: **Accepted · Proposed · Superseded · Revises-brief
(flagged for sign-off)**.

> **Accepted at the Phase 0 gate (2026-06-01):** ADR-0001 and ADR-0002 revised the brief's stated versions
> (Laravel 11 → **13**, Livewire 3 → **4**) and the **PHP 8.2 → 8.3** floor, on live-validated evidence and the
> project lead's explicit sign-off. `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/PROJECT-BRIEF.md` were updated to match.

## ADR detail (concise)

### ADR-0001 — Framework & rendering stack
**Context:** need one server-rendered, SEO-safe codebase that installs on a shared host (no Node SSR, no
daemon) yet supports a modern product surface. **Decision:** Laravel 13 + Livewire 4 + Alpine + Blade,
server-rendered; reject Inertia+Vue/React SPA (needs Node SSR for SEO). **Consequences:** one codebase across
tiers; rich client widgets become Alpine islands; revises brief's "Laravel 11 / Livewire 3" to current stable.

### ADR-0002 — Minimum PHP 8.3
**Context:** Laravel 13 requires PHP 8.3; PHP 8.2 reaches EOL 2026-12-31. **Decision:** floor at 8.3, recommend
8.4+. **Consequences:** **revised the Checkpoint-approved 8.2 floor** — starting a 2026 project on a soon-EOL
runtime is indefensible, and reputable shared hosts offer 8.3/8.4 by mid-2026. **Signed off at the Phase 0 gate (2026-06-01).**

### ADR-0005 — Canonical content storage
**Context:** WYSIWYG-first, but must render safely, search well, re-transform, and import legacy BBCode.
**Decision:** store a lossless **canonical** doc (TipTap JSON / Markdown / legacy) + a **server-sanitized HTML
cache** + a **plain-text** projection; HTML always (re)generated server-side from canonical (the security
boundary). **Consequences:** lossless edit, safe render, future-proof re-render, easy search; needs a server
JSON→HTML renderer (MIT lib) + allowlist sanitizer (license vetted here).

### ADR-0006 — Permission-mask resolution
**Context:** phpBB-grade ACL is a primary requirement. **Decision:** three-state ALLOW/NO/**NEVER** (NEVER
absolute), holders = users + primary/secondary groups, scope chain global→category→forum→thread (local
overrides global, user overrides group, most-permissive group, deny-by-default), role presets, cached resolved
masks (>95% hit), admin "why can/can't X" inspector. **Consequences:** the spine of the app; dedicated
truth-table tests; anti-spam gating reuses it (ADR-0007). **NO semantics (owner-confirmed 2026-06-02):**
`NO` = neutral/inherit (**interpretation "ii"**) — an `ALLOW` lifts it and inheritance continues past it; use
`NEVER` to hard-deny. The single decision point is marked inline in `PermissionResolver::compute()` and pinned
by the truth-table suite.

### ADR-0007 — First-class anti-spam
**Context:** spam is the #1 evidenced operator burden and Hearth's differentiator. **Decision:** layered
defense (registration blocklist + CAPTCHA abstraction + honeypot + velocity; trust levels as ACL groups;
post-time scanning + rate limits + moderation queue; Spam Cleaner), **gating expressed through the
permission-mask engine** (NEVER = hard gate, NO = soft gate), all baseline-safe/graceful. **Consequences:**
unified with permissions + inspectable; external services optional; documented threshold defaults; privacy/GDPR
retention on registration checks.

**M3 implementation notes (2026-06-03):** TL gating is seeded as `acl_entries` on the TL groups from a
config matrix (`config/hearth.php`), enforced by link/image **suppression at the shared sanitize step** (the
canonical stays lossless, ADR-0005); auto promotion/demotion runs via the idempotent `hearth:trust:recompute`
cron. Registration is a tri-state screener (StopForumSpam live→cron-cached→no-signal; disposable-email;
honeypot+timing; IP velocity) + a `CaptchaProvider` abstraction that **degrades to Q&A** when an external
provider is absent. Post-time moderation = a `ContentScanner` **contract** (local heuristics now; **Akismet is
Phase 2** behind the same contract), word filters, and a new-user/`status=pending` queue. **Deliberate
deviations (recorded per the conventions):** the `rate_limit_hits` table is **not** created — Laravel's
cache-backed `RateLimiter` is already DB-on-baseline→Redis-on-enhanced (tier-graceful); `mod_actions` is **not**
created — the append-only `audit_log` subsumes it. Issuing/lifting a **ban now bumps the ACL version** so a
cached verdict can't outlive it. **No new runtime/dev dependencies** were added in M3 (Http via the
framework's bundled client; `symfony/html-sanitizer` and `league/commonmark` already present).

### ADR-0011 — Queue via cron
**Context:** baseline hosts can't run a worker daemon. **Decision:** DB queue drained by a single
`schedule:run` cron with a bounded `queue:work --stop-when-empty`, overlap-locked; all async work idempotent
and correct within one (possibly coarse 5–15 min) cron interval. **Consequences:** "one cron line" baseline;
swap to Redis+worker on enhanced with no code change.

### ADR-0015 — Dependency licensing
**Context:** Apache-2.0 + clean-room. **Decision:** every dependency Apache-2.0-compatible (MIT/BSD/Apache/
ISC); **no GPL/AGPL bundled**; **TipTap: MIT core/extensions only** (its Pro/collaboration packages are
commercial — never pulled); Typesense (GPL server) only as an optional out-of-process service, never bundled.
**Consequences:** per-dependency license recorded here before merge.

### ADR-0012 — Editor integration (validated by Spike 0, 2026-06-02)
**Context:** the TipTap↔Livewire-4 integration was the project's #1 technical risk; ADR-0012 proposed a
`wire:ignore` Alpine island. **Validation:** Spike 0 returned **GO** — all six acceptance criteria passed with
executed evidence (Pest 10 tests / 82 assertions incl. the XSS battery; Playwright 6/6 incl. the #1a
state-survival GO-blocker). See [spike-0-memo.md](docs/product/spike-0-memo.md). **No fallback was needed; the
decision stands.** **Binding implementation constraint:** the TipTap instance must live in **per-instance
closure state, never a reactive Alpine property** — a reactive proxy wraps ProseMirror's state and makes
programmatic commands throw *"Applying a mismatched transaction."* Canonical TipTap JSON syncs to Livewire via a
**deferred `$wire.set` (no debounce)**; HTML is always rendered + sanitized server-side (ADR-0005). Livewire 4
components are **single-file** (`⚡`-prefixed). Full M2 notes: [phase-1-plan.md](docs/product/phase-1-plan.md) §4.

### ADR-0019 — Authentication & two-factor (M1)
**Context:** M1 needs register / verify / login / password-reset on the baseline tier (server-rendered,
no SPA), with strong hashing and mandatory 2FA for privileged accounts. **Decision:** use **Laravel
Fortify** (headless — backend only) behind **our own clean-room Blade views**, not a starter kit;
**argon2id** as the default password hash (bcrypt fallback for hosts lacking libargon2); rate-limited
login (5/min per email+IP) and 2FA challenge; **TOTP 2FA mandatory for staff** (admins & moderators —
enforced by the `RequireTwoFactorForStaff` middleware on privileged routes), **opt-in** for general users
(Phase 2 "Should"). The admin panels are gated on the `admin.access` permission via the engine (ADR-0006).
**WebAuthn/passkeys are deferred** — `laravel/passkeys` ships as a Fortify dependency but the feature,
routes, and table are intentionally not enabled in M1. **Consequences:** no client framework required for
auth; 2FA secrets/recovery codes encrypted at rest; the first admin is created by the installer (a later
slice), not seeded. Dedicated feature tests cover registration, throttling, reset, verification, the full
2FA enable/confirm/challenge flow, and the staff-2FA gate.

### ADR-0020 — No-SSH web installer, lock, and backups (M5)
**Context:** Hearth must be installable by ordinary operators on a shared host with no SSH, and the
installer is an **unauthenticated pre-install surface** that writes secrets, runs migrations, and creates
the admin — the highest-risk code path in the project. **Decision:** a browser wizard (requirement/tier
probes → DB → site & admin → run) backed by a single `App\Install\InstallRunner` shared with a
`hearth:install` CLI, so there is exactly one audited install sequence. The **lock** is a `storage/installed`
**file marker** (not a DB flag — checkable before the DB exists, survives a DB wipe), written **last**; once
present, `EnsureNotInstalled` returns 403 and **no web route clears it** (reset is a deliberate filesystem
action = shell trust). A pre-install boot hook forces zero-dependency drivers (file session/cache, sync
queue) + an ensured APP_KEY so a fresh upload boots with no DB. **Backups** are one portable `.zip` (DB dump
+ storage mirror + a manifest carrying a **SHA-256** of the dump); restore validates the manifest + verifies
the hash before overwriting. **Consequences:** input validated server-side; secrets never rendered back nor
logged; the lock has no re-trigger/admin-reset vector; the upgrade safety net (reversible migrations +
backup→restore) is proven by a round-trip test. Tests opt out of enforcement (`HEARTH_INSTALL_ENFORCE=false`)
so the M0–M4 suite is untouched.

### ADR-0021 — No-SSH automatic upgrade (RH-10)
**Context:** `getting-started.md` §5 promised "deploy the new version (it migrates automatically)", but
nothing implemented it — the only `migrate` call lived in `InstallRunner` (install time). A no-SSH operator
who extracts a new release over a live install runs **new code against the old schema, with no way to
migrate**: the very next themed release adds `users.color_mode`/`density`, so until they're applied, saving
Appearance settings errors (a write to a missing column) and any future destructive migration (a dropped/
renamed/retyped read-path column) breaks pages site-wide — with no no-SSH recourse. (Additive *reads*
degrade to `null` with strict mode off, so it is the missing migrate path, not a guaranteed every-page 500,
that is the gate.) A beta gate.

**Decision:** a cron-driven, **backup-first, maintenance-safe** automatic migration, in `App\Upgrade`.
- **Detection (cheap).** `SchemaState` keeps one cache key. The **request path** is O(cache-read): it reads
  the cached flag and compares a **release fingerprint** (a sha256 of the deployed migration filenames —
  a glob, no DB) against the recorded one. A mismatch ⇒ "new code, schema behind" ⇒ gate — which closes the
  deploy→first-tick window the scheduler alone would leave open. The **scheduler tick** does the real,
  DB-heavy `migrator` check and refreshes the flag. `GET /health` gains a non-secret `schema` block
  (`pending`/`upgrading`/`stuck`/`auto`/`last`) so the owner/Cowork verify a live upgrade remotely.
- **The run** (`UpgradeRunner`, every minute, `withoutOverlapping` **+** a cache lock so it can never
  double-run): enter maintenance → **take a backup** (failure ABORTS — stay pending, surface loudly) →
  `migrate --force` in-process → refresh caches → exit maintenance → audit-log (count, duration, backup).
  A run killed mid-migration is **resumed idempotently** next tick (already-applied migrations are skipped).
- **The window.** `PreventRequestsDuringUpgrade` serves a branded **503** (Retry-After, self-refreshing) for
  every request except the health endpoints (so the upgrade is watchable) and assets — never a raw SQL error.
- **Failure policy.** On a migrate failure, best-effort roll back **this run's** batch only (never the prior
  good batch — a single migration that recorded nothing leaves the **backup** as the recovery path, since
  MySQL DDL is not transactional); stay in maintenance; **hold** (`schema.stuck`) after at most
  `max_auto_attempts` (default 2) — **no retry loop**. The hold self-clears when the operator re-uploads the
  previous release (drift resolved).
- **Operator controls.** `HEARTH_AUTO_UPGRADE=true` by default (the promise). `false` = manual: nothing
  auto-runs and *Admin → System → Upgrade* / `php artisan hearth:upgrade` apply on demand. **Asymmetry
  (documented):** auto mode is what shields signed-in pages during the window; manual mode keeps the site
  reachable so the admin can apply, so those pages may error on new columns until they do.

**Consequences:** the documented promise is true on the baseline tier with zero new dependencies; the
≤~2-minute window on a 1-minute cron protects signed-in pages from new-column 500s; reversible migrations +
the pre-upgrade backup are the recovery net; the cached state is scalars-only so it survives a serializing
store under the RH-9 anti-object-injection hardening. Tested at the feature level driving the runner
directly (detection on/off · lock · backup→migrate ordering & backup-abort · failure→rollback+stuck · health
schema · 503-not-SQL during the window · auto-off + manual apply). See
[real-host-findings RH-10](docs/product/real-host-findings.md).

## Dependency license register (ADR-0015)

Per ADR-0015, each dependency is recorded with its license before merge. All are Apache-2.0-compatible
(MIT/BSD); **no GPL/AGPL is bundled**.

**M0 — repo-root app (2026-06-02):**

| Package | Version | License | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| laravel/framework | 13.13 | MIT | core |
| livewire/livewire | 4.3 | MIT | server-driven UI |
| laravel/scout | 11.2 | MIT | search abstraction (DB driver = baseline) |
| laravel/pint | 1.29 | MIT | dev — code style |
| larastan/larastan | 3.10 | MIT | dev — static analysis |
| pestphp/pest (+ pest-plugin-laravel) | 4.7 / 4.1 | MIT | dev — tests |
| laravel/dusk | 8.6 | MIT | dev — browser tests (used from M2) |

**M1 — identity & auth (2026-06-02):**

| Package | Version | License | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| laravel/fortify | 1.37 | MIT | headless auth — register/login/reset/verify/2FA; our own Blade views |
| pragmarx/google2fa | 9.0 | MIT | TOTP generation/verification for 2FA; pulled by Fortify |
| bacon/bacon-qr-code | 3.1 | BSD-2-Clause | QR-code SVG for 2FA enrolment; pulled by Fortify |
| paragonie/constant_time_encoding | 3.1 | MIT | constant-time base32/hex (transitive, via google2fa) |
| laravel/passkeys | 0.2 | MIT | **dormant** — a Fortify dependency; the passkeys feature, routes, and table are **not enabled** in M1 (out of scope) |

**M2 — forum content (2026-06-03):**

| Package | Version | License | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| symfony/html-sanitizer | 7.4 | MIT | the allowlist sanitizer — the content security boundary (ADR-0005 / security §4) |
| league/commonmark | 2.8 | BSD-3-Clause | Markdown input mode (already present via the framework; used with html_input=escape + unsafe-links denied, then sanitized) |
| @tiptap/* (core, pm, starter-kit, placeholder, mention, image, table, suggestion) | 3.x | MIT | WYSIWYG editor (JS); **no @tiptap-pro/***. Lazy chunk **132 KB gz**, code-split out of the 1 KB main bundle |

**Canonical-render decision (ADR-0005):** kept the **hand-rolled** TipTap-JSON→HTML mapper
(`app/Content/CanonicalRenderer`) rather than adding a `tiptap-php` dependency — it *is* the security
boundary, is small and fully under our control, and is proven by the XSS battery; `symfony/html-sanitizer`
is the authoritative allowlist backstop for every render path. (Editor-side `@tiptap/*` JS packages, all MIT,
are recorded with the editor commit.)

**M4 — notifications · search · SEO · theme (2026-06-03):** **No new dependencies.** Notifications use
Laravel's `notifications` table with a custom merge-aware `Notifier` (db + queued mail, ADR-0014); search uses
`laravel/scout` (already present, M0) on the `database` driver with a `SearchService` that **degrades to a
direct DB query** when the configured engine is absent (ADR-0010, tier-graceful); SEO is hand-rolled JSON-LD +
a cached sitemap (system-architecture §6); the **theme override layer** (`App\Theme\ThemeManager`, ADR-0009)
is a custom, semver'd contract over Blade's view finder (active theme → parent → core), documented in
[THEME-API.md](docs/THEME-API.md) (**THEME API v1.0**). Signatures reuse the M2 canonical pipeline + sanitizer.
Avatars/covers use the `public` disk (needs `storage:link`, an installer step). M4 implementation note: an
`@mention` notification is parsed from the canonical doc; held posts notify at approval, not at write.

**M5 — operability & the runnable MVP (2026-06-03):** **No new dependencies.** The installer, backups,
restore, health endpoint, demo seed, and scheduler are built on the framework: `symfony/process` (DB dump/
restore via `mysqldump`/`mysql`/`pg_dump`/`pg_restore`) and PHP's `ZipArchive` were already present (the M0
`hearth:backup` skeleton used them); the wizard is a single-file Livewire component; the perf budgets are a
Pest `Performance` suite + shell asset checks in CI. The Dusk editor journey was **executed for real** in a
new `docker/dusk/` Chrome image + a CI job (php:8.3 + system Chromium/ChromeDriver) — `laravel/dusk` (M0
dev-dep) and `@tiptap/*` (M2) are unchanged. **M5 implementation notes:** the install lock is a filesystem
marker, not a DB row (ADR-0020); `wire:model.blur` on the create-topic title (a value typed after a
validation-error morph reliably syncs on resubmit — found by running Dusk); the demo seed pins mail to the
array transport so it never hits SMTP during install.

**SPDX policy:** Hearth-authored source carries an `SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0` header. Laravel's
scaffolded stubs are left as-is and gain a header when meaningfully edited — retrofitting every stub adds
noise without value.

*(Spike 0 deps are recorded in [spike-0-memo.md](docs/product/spike-0-memo.md): `@tiptap/*` 3.24 MIT (core
only, never Pro), `symfony/html-sanitizer` 7.4 MIT, `@playwright/test` 1.60 MIT.)*
