# PROJECT-STATE.md — NovFora (session resume / handoff)

> **Purpose:** single source of truth for where this project stands right now. Read this **first**, every
> session — both Claude Code and Claude Cowork. Keep it at the repo root. Whoever is working keeps it updated.
>
> **Completed milestone history → [`PROJECT-HISTORY.md`](PROJECT-HISTORY.md)** (moved to keep this file lean).
>
> **Standing detail lives in the folder — read, don't restate:** `docs/PROJECT-BRIEF.md` (full spec) ·
> `CLAUDE.md` (rules, model/effort routing) · `DECISIONS.md` (ADR log) · `ARCHITECTURE.md` ·
> `docs/architecture/`, `docs/product/`, `docs/research/` (Stage A set).

## What this is

**NovFora** (name locked 2026-06-10, ADR-0026; "Hearth" and "NevoBB" are **retired codenames**; in-code
rename complete 2026-06-11, commit `b0cc294`) — open-source (**Apache-2.0**), self-hosted forum/community
platform; modern PHP; **two tiers from one codebase** (baseline shared PHP host / enhanced Docker-VPS);
WYSIWYG-first editor; phpBB-grade permission masks; strict clean-room.

## Current stack

**Laravel 13 + Livewire 4 + Alpine.js + Blade**, server-rendered. PHP 8.3 floor. MySQL 8 / MariaDB default;
PostgreSQL on Docker/VPS. Vite, prebuilt assets (no host Node). Approved — ADR-0001/0002 (Accepted).

## How we work

- **Claude Code (build):** scaffolds and writes the Laravel app. Plan-before-code per phase.
- **Claude Cowork (knowledge work):** reviews plans/docs, preps gate packets, writes status summaries. No app code.
- **Don't run both against the working tree at the same time.** Commit between handoffs; git is the source of truth.
- **Two stages, gated:** Stage A (Discovery) → Phase 0 gate **passed** → Stage B phased implementation
  (plan-before-code, wait for approval per phase).

## Status (as of 2026-06-12)

**Phase 1 / Core MVP · Phase 1.5 hardening · real-host fixes RH-6–RH-11 — all COMPLETE.** Default theme +
polish R1, ACP v1/v1.1, Spike P2 deliverability (GO), and **ACP v2** all merged. **Phase 2 (Community) —
COMPLETE.** P2-M1 through **P2-M5** are all merged to `main`: the M5 ADR-0028 **social pack (follow +
reputation + badges)** + beta polish + the full regression (executed RH-10/RH-11 rehearsals) shipped, and
**`v1.0.0-beta.1` is tagged → 🚩 Public Beta**. **Next: build + deploy the beta to the live host, gather
feedback, then open Phase 3 (Extensibility) — see Immediate next actions.**

**`main` carries:** M0–M5, P1.5 hardening, real-host fixes RH-6–RH-11, default theme + theme polish R1,
ACP v1 + v1.1 patch, Spike P2 deliverability pipeline, NovFora rename (ADR-0024/0026), **ACP v2** (PR #9,
`30bc466`), **P2-M1** engagement/content-depth, **P2-M2 Half-A** deliverability light-up, **P2-M2 Half-B**
multi-participant PMs (PR #17, `535a924`), **P2 account deletion** (ADR-0025, `b006163`), **P2-M3** activity
feed & community-feel core (`ae9bba3`), **P2-M4** moderation depth / search facets / preferences (PR #19,
`c56126e`), and **P2-M5** the social pack (follow / reputation / badges) + beta polish + full regression —
**tagged `v1.0.0-beta.1` (🚩 Public Beta)**. **Origin `main` is the source of truth; nothing is left unpushed.**

**Post-beta polish — built + green, on branch `claude/acp-themes-members-directory` (pending owner push → PR →
merge):** **DB-backed style themes** / in-admin visual theme editor (ADR-0029) · **public members directory**
with admin-controlled visibility (ADR-0030) · `users.post_count` now **maintained** (atomic ±1 on
create/soft-delete/restore) **+ backfilled** — closes the M0 "unmaintained seam" flagged in ADR-0028 · minor
UI width + profile-link polish. 6 conventional commits; full suite **972 green** (pint/larastan/audit clean).

**Stage A fast-follows — DONE (2026-06-13, owner-authorized overnight build, branch
`claude/stage-a-fast-follows`, pending owner push → PR → merge).** All six M5-deferred / review-flagged
fast-follows shipped, each its own gated + committed unit; full suite **1012 green** (pint/larastan/audit
clean). Design notes in `DECISIONS.md → Fast-follow backlog notes`.
- **A1 staff notes** (`869c0db`) — private staff-only notes on a member (`bans.manage`-gated, never the
  subject); `staff_notes` table, `StaffNote`, `App\Moderation\StaffNotes` authority, profile SFC, audited;
  ADR-0025 cascade NULLs the author.
- **A2 reputation leaderboard** (`fdc7b1f`) — public `/members/top` board (reputation / posts, all-time /
  30-day / 7-day), shares the directory visibility gate; windowed views aggregate the source of truth.
- **A3 trust auto-promotion by reputation** (`cc01545`, APEX) — `min_reputation` on tl2/tl3, a PROMOTION-ONLY
  gate (never spurious-demotes), seeder + upgrade-backfill migration.
- **A4 second example theme** (`73b9f8f`) — `themes/aurora` filesystem child theme + two core override seams
  (head palette / footer); AA-safe palette via `AccentPalette`; ships inactive.
- **A5 isSoleAdmin TOCTOU** (`57d0669`, APEX) — locked re-check inside the deletion transaction.
- **A6 ActivityVersion / AclVersion lost-bump** (`b11eb46`, APEX) — atomic `Cache::add`+`increment`.

*Follow + reputation/points + badges shipped earlier in M5 Core per ADR-0028.*

## Immediate next actions

1. **▶ NEXT — ship & validate the 🚩 Public Beta.** Build the deployable upgrade package from `main` and
   deploy it live (in-place, no-SSH RH-10 upgrade) per
   [`docs/product/live-deploy-kickoff.md`](docs/product/live-deploy-kickoff.md) — back up off-host, extract
   over the running install, watch `GET /health` `schema.pending` flip true→false. Then gather
   private/public-beta feedback (product-plan §8 may reorder later work).

2. **Phase 3 — Extensibility — the next major phase (its own discovery + plan-before-code gate).**
   Module/plugin API + hook/event/slot system (semver'd public contract) + compatibility check; visual
   theming + layout configurator; REST API + webhooks; phpBB/MyBB/SMF importers (verify + 301 redirects);
   admin analytics.

3. ~~**Fast-follows queued by M5**~~ — **DONE 2026-06-13** (Stage A, see the "Stage A fast-follows" block
   above): staff notes · reputation leaderboard / top-members · TL auto-promotion by reputation · 2nd example
   theme · `isSoleAdmin` TOCTOU + `ActivityVersion`/`AclVersion` lost-bump hardenings. On branch
   `claude/stage-a-fast-follows` (owner push → PR → merge).

4. **Design-first items still queued (do not build without a plan):**
   - RH-4: subdirectory install (ADR needed)
   - Layman "simple-mode" permissions UX (ACP v3, separate cycle)

## Working rules

Full rules in `CLAUDE.md`. Short form: strict clean-room · progressive enhancement · reversible migrations ·
security by default · tests with every feature · semver'd module/theme API · conventional commits + ADRs.

## Model & effort

Full routing in `CLAUDE.md §Model routing`. Short form:
- **`ultracode` (default):** start at **Fable @ max** (apex), downgrade as fit when work is pattern-replication.
- **Fable @ max:** permission/security/concurrency core, adversarial reviews, spikes, mechanism/API design.
- **Opus 4.8 `xhigh`/`high`:** heavy correctness work below the apex.
- **Sonnet 4.6:** CRUD, scaffolding, view boilerplate, mechanical breadth, multi-site sweeps (sub-agents).
- **Docker gates are free** — verify with `pest`/`pint`/`larastan`, not by re-reasoning.
- Never re-read a file you just edited (the harness tracks state). Cap gate output — tail/`Select-Object -Last`.
