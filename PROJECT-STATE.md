## ⭐ Overnight autonomous build — 2026-06-13 (REVIEW THIS FIRST)

An unattended run completed **Stage A (6 M5-deferred fast-follows)** and **Stage B (Phase 3 Extensibility — all
5 subsystems)**. Everything is gated green and committed; **nothing is pushed** (see push status). Every Phase-3
ADR is marked **"Accepted — owner-authorized overnight build; flagged for review"** — give them a human pass
before 1.0.

**Gate status (final):** `composer test` (parallel) **1077 passed, 1 skipped (3598 assertions)** · `pint`
clean (620 files) · `phpstan` (level 5) clean · run via `docker exec forum-dev`. (Baseline started at 972.)

**Branches (⚠ owner must push — `git push` is interactive-only and times out in-sandbox; `gh` absent):**
- `claude/stage-a-fast-follows` — Stage A, 7 commits `869c0db..93e83ea`, atop `origin/main` (152276f).
- `claude/phase-3-extensibility` — Stage B, 7 commits `45407eb..37f5e45`, **branched off the Stage-A tip**
  (so it contains Stage A too). Suggested merge order: Stage A PR first, then Phase 3 PR (which then shows only
  its own commits); or merge Phase 3 directly (includes Stage A).

### Stage A — fast-follows (branch `claude/stage-a-fast-follows`)
| # | What | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | Staff notes — private, staff-only (`bans.manage`, never the subject); audited; ADR-0025 author de-id | `869c0db` |
| A2 | Public "Top members" leaderboard (rep/posts × all-time/30d/7d); shares the directory visibility gate | `fdc7b1f` |
| A3 | **APEX** Trust auto-promotion by reputation — a PROMOTION-ONLY floor (never spurious-demotes) + upgrade migration | `cc01545` |
| A4 | Aurora filesystem child theme + two core override seams (AA-safe palette); ships inactive | `73b9f8f` |
| A5 | **APEX** isSoleAdmin TOCTOU — locked re-check inside the deletion transaction | `57d0669` |
| A6 | **APEX** ActivityVersion/AclVersion lost-bump — atomic `Cache::add`+`increment` | `b11eb46` |

### Stage B — Phase 3 Extensibility (branch `claude/phase-3-extensibility`)
| # | Subsystem | ADR | Commit(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | Module/plugin foundation — manifest+validation, lifecycle, deps/compat, events/filter-hooks/slots, perms, ACP, example plugin | 0031 | `45407eb`, `b54e858` | **APEX boundary.** Post-build adversarial review found + fixed a HIGH path-traversal (`b54e858`) |
| B2 | Visual theming + layout configurator — `ThemeApi` token contract, widget/region system, ACP | 0032 | `8633f28` | |
| B3 | REST API (`/api/v1`, token auth, engine-authorized, paginated, rate-limited) + outbound webhooks (HMAC, cron retry, SSRF guard) | 0033 | `cc936e5`, `160745e` | **APEX boundary** |
| B4 | Importers — clean-room, driver-based | 0034 | `fce128d` | **phpBB built + tested; MyBB + SMF SCAFFOLDED** (schema mapped, unverified) |
| B5 | Admin analytics — privacy-conscious aggregate daily rollup (cron) + dashboard | 0035 | `37f5e45` | |

Phase-3 design set: **`docs/architecture/phase3-extensibility/`** (module-system, theming-layout, api-webhooks,
importers, analytics).

### Partial / scaffolded / flagged for review
- **B4 MyBB + SMF drivers are scaffolds** — schema mapped behind the same `SourceDriver`, **not verified against
  a live board**; their hash schemes aren't Laravel-verifiable so those users reset on first login. Importer
  **verify is count-reconciliation** (attachment import + checksum verify is a documented follow-up).
- **B1 module trust model is full-PHP-trust** (no PHP sandbox is feasible — documented). The SSRF guard (B3) is
  literal-host/IP based (no DNS-rebinding protection). These are documented in their ADRs, not bugs.
- The 6 untracked `docs/product/*.md` kickoff files + `provider-symfony~var-dumper.json` were present **before**
  this run and are left untouched (not part of any commit).

### Key assumptions recorded inline + in `DECISIONS.md`
Staff notes reuse the existing `bans.manage` (no new permission key). Trust rep-gate is promotion-only (floor at
current level). Module permission keys only ADD to the catalog (never escalate). Slot/filter/widget HTML is
re-sanitised through the post-HTML allowlist. Webhooks degrade on the baseline tier via the cron runner; the
dispatcher is gated on a cached "any active endpoints" flag so the no-endpoints case adds zero hot-path queries.
Importers go through the Eloquent models (not the services) so a bulk import fires no domain events. Analytics
store aggregates only (no PII); `daily_metrics.metric_date` is a plain `Y-m-d` string. Full per-subsystem
rationale: `DECISIONS.md` ADR-0031…0035 + the "Fast-follow backlog notes" section.

## What this is

**NovFora** (name locked 2026-06-10, ADR-0026; "Hearth" and "NevoBB" are **retired codenames**; in-code
rename complete 2026-06-11, commit `b0cc294`) — open-source (**Apache-2.0**), self-hosted forum/community
platform; modern PHP; **two tiers from one codebase** (baseline shared PHP host / enhanced Docker-VPS);
WYSIWYG-first editor; phpBB-grade permission masks; strict clean-room.

## Current stack

**Laravel 13 + Livewire 4 + Alpine.js + Blade**, server-rendered. PHP 8.3 floor. MySQL 8 / MariaDB default;
PostgreSQL on Docker/VPS. Vite, prebuilt assets (no host Node). Approved — ADR-0001/0002 (Accepted).

## How we work

- **Claude Code (build):** scaffolds and writes the Laravel app. Plan-before-code per phase.
- **Claude Cowork (knowledge work):** reviews plans/docs, preps gate packets, writes status summaries. No app code.
- **Don't run both against the working tree at the same time.** Commit between handoffs; git is the source of truth.
- **Two stages, gated:** Stage A (Discovery) → Phase 0 gate **passed** → Stage B phased implementation
  (plan-before-code, wait for approval per phase).

## Status (as of 2026-06-12)

**Phase 1 / Core MVP · Phase 1.5 hardening · real-host fixes RH-6–RH-11 — all COMPLETE.** Default theme +
polish R1, ACP v1/v1.1, Spike P2 deliverability (GO), and **ACP v2** all merged. **Phase 2 (Community) —
COMPLETE.** P2-M1 through **P2-M5** are all merged to `main`: the M5 ADR-0028 **social pack (follow +
reputation + badges)** + beta polish + the full regression (executed RH-10/RH-11 rehearsals) shipped, and
**`v1.0.0-beta.1` is tagged → 🚩 Public Beta**. **Next: build + deploy the beta to the live host, gather
feedback, then open Phase 3 (Extensibility) — see Immediate next actions.**

> Per-milestone build detail (gates, test counts, adversarial-review findings, scope fences) →
> [`PROJECT-HISTORY.md`](PROJECT-HISTORY.md).

**`main` carries:** M0–M5, P1.5 hardening, real-host fixes RH-6–RH-11, default theme + theme polish R1,
ACP v1 + v1.1 patch, Spike P2 deliverability pipeline, NovFora rename (ADR-0024/0026), **ACP v2** (PR #9,
`30bc466`), **P2-M1** engagement/content-depth, **P2-M2 Half-A** deliverability light-up, **P2-M2 Half-B**
multi-participant PMs (PR #17, `535a924`), **P2 account deletion** (ADR-0025, `b006163`), **P2-M3** activity
feed & community-feel core (`ae9bba3`), **P2-M4** moderation depth / search facets / preferences (PR #19,
`c56126e`), and **P2-M5** the social pack (follow / reputation / badges) + beta polish + full regression —
**tagged `v1.0.0-beta.1` (🚩 Public Beta)**. **Origin `main` is the source of truth; nothing is left unpushed.**

**Post-beta polish — built + green, on branch `claude/acp-themes-members-directory` (pending owner push → PR →
merge):** **DB-backed style themes** / in-admin visual theme editor (ADR-0029) · **public members directory**
with admin-controlled visibility (ADR-0030) · `users.post_count` now **maintained** (atomic ±1 on
create/soft-delete/restore) **+ backfilled** — closes the M0 "unmaintained seam" flagged in ADR-0028 · minor
UI width + profile-link polish. 6 conventional commits; full suite **972 green** (pint/larastan/audit clean).

**Stage A fast-follows — DONE (2026-06-13, owner-authorized overnight build, branch
`claude/stage-a-fast-follows`, pending owner push → PR → merge).** All six M5-deferred / review-flagged
fast-follows shipped, each its own gated + committed unit; full suite **1012 green** (pint/larastan/audit
clean). Design notes in `DECISIONS.md → Fast-follow backlog notes`.
- **A1 staff notes** (`869c0db`) — private staff-only notes on a member (`bans.manage`-gated, never the
  subject); `staff_notes` table, `StaffNote`, `App\Moderation\StaffNotes` authority, profile SFC, audited;
  ADR-0025 cascade NULLs the author.
- **A2 reputation leaderboard** (`fdc7b1f`) — public `/members/top` board (reputation / posts, all-time /
  30-day / 7-day), shares the directory visibility gate; windowed views aggregate the source of truth.
- **A3 trust auto-promotion by reputation** (`cc01545`, APEX) — `min_reputation` on tl2/tl3, a PROMOTION-ONLY
  gate (never spurious-demotes), seeder + upgrade-backfill migration.
- **A4 second example theme** (`73b9f8f`) — `themes/aurora` filesystem child theme + two core override seams
  (head palette / footer); AA-safe palette via `AccentPalette`; ships inactive.
- **A5 isSoleAdmin TOCTOU** (`57d0669`, APEX) — locked re-check inside the deletion transaction.
- **A6 ActivityVersion / AclVersion lost-bump** (`b11eb46`, APEX) — atomic `Cache::add`+`increment`.

*Follow + reputation/points + badges shipped earlier in M5 Core per ADR-0028.*

## Immediate next actions

1. **▶ NEXT — ship & validate the 🚩 Public Beta.** Build the deployable upgrade package from `main` and
   deploy it live (in-place, no-SSH RH-10 upgrade) per
   [`docs/product/live-deploy-kickoff.md`](docs/product/live-deploy-kickoff.md) — back up off-host, extract
   over the running install, watch `GET /health` `schema.pending` flip true→false. Then gather
   private/public-beta feedback (product-plan §8 may reorder later work).

2. **Phase 3 — Extensibility — the next major phase (its own discovery + plan-before-code gate).**
   Module/plugin API + hook/event/slot system (semver'd public contract) + compatibility check; visual
   theming + layout configurator; REST API + webhooks; phpBB/MyBB/SMF importers (verify + 301 redirects);
   admin analytics.

3. ~~**Fast-follows queued by M5**~~ — **DONE 2026-06-13** (Stage A, see the "Stage A fast-follows" block
   above): staff notes · reputation leaderboard / top-members · TL auto-promotion by reputation · 2nd example
   theme · `isSoleAdmin` TOCTOU + `ActivityVersion`/`AclVersion` lost-bump hardenings. On branch
   `claude/stage-a-fast-follows` (owner push → PR → merge).

4. **Design-first items still queued (do not build without a plan):**
   - RH-4: subdirectory install (ADR needed)
   - Layman "simple-mode" permissions UX (ACP v3, separate cycle)

## Working rules

Full rules in `CLAUDE.md`. Short form: strict clean-room · progressive enhancement · reversible migrations ·
security by default · tests with every feature · semver'd module/theme API · conventional commits + ADRs.

## Model & effort

Full routing in `CLAUDE.md §Model routing`. Short form:
- **`ultracode` (default):** start at **Fable @ max** (apex), downgrade as fit when work is pattern-replication.
- **Fable @ max:** permission/security/concurrency core, adversarial reviews, spikes, mechanism/API design.
- **Opus 4.8 `xhigh`/`high`:** heavy correctness work below the apex.
- **Sonnet 4.6:** CRUD, scaffolding, view boilerplate, mechanical breadth, multi-site sweeps (sub-agents).
- **Docker gates are free** — verify with `pest`/`pint`/`larastan`, not by re-reasoning.
- Never re-read a file you just edited (the harness tracks state). Cap gate output — tail/`Select-Object -Last`.
